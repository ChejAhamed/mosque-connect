# Release Notes: Version 80.3 - Select Component Fix & Deployment

## Key Improvements

### 1. Fixed Select Component Empty String Value Error
- **Issue**: Select component was throwing runtime errors due to empty string values in SelectItem components
- **Root Cause**: Radix UI's Select component doesn't allow empty string values for SelectItem, causing runtime exceptions
- **Fix**:
  - Changed empty string values to "all" for consistency in filter dropdowns
  - Enhanced SelectItem component to be more robust against empty or whitespace values
  - Fixed filtering logic to handle the new "all" value correctly across components

### 2. Optimized for Netlify Deployment
- Configured application for Netlify deployment
- Updated netlify.toml with proper build settings
- Added documentation for Netlify deployment process

### 3. Removed Sensitive Information from Documentation
- Ensured all sensitive information (database credentials, API keys, secrets) is only stored in environment variables
- Updated .gitignore to prevent environment files from being committed
- Added security best practices to documentation

### 4. Created Static Landing Page
- Added a detailed explanation of the fixed bug
- Provides a quick reference to the updates made in this version
